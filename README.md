## (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ *:✧ MINING LARGE DATA SETS  ✧*

 For anyone who is completely new: Welcome! Coding is hard, but maybe this will help.
 This repository can be used to find sequences in a large database that are sequentially similar to a query
 
 The commands.sh notebook has the commands that need to be executed to find sequentially similar hits, BUT before running them follow the instructions below.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
### Preparing all of the variables
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

 1. Create script directory where you can pull from my script repository on github : https://github.com/zeeboe/data_mining.git

 2. Create a home directory where the resulting files can be deposited

 3. Create a database.fasta file that has all of the sequences in the database in FASTA format

 4. Create a sequences.fasta file that is a list of FASTA sequences similar to the query sequence from various organisms. Name this fasta file with the naming convention 'query_sequences.fasta' (query can be whatever you choose to name the query, the important part is the "_sequences.fasta")

Acknowledgements : To anyone who ever helped make the muscle, hmmbuild, hmmsearch commands, Daryl Barth, and Rachael Cox who are great and taught me how to suffer for my art (this code).
